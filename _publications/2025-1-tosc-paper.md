permalink: https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/12086
excerpt: 'In this paper, we extend the quasidifferential framework from Beyne and Rijmen to the related-key setting. Furthermore, we also extend it to compute the EDP of a characteristic. We also propose some practical modeling of those extensions and apply them on SKINNY and the AES.'
