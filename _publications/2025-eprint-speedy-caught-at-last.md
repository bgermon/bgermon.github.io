excerpt: "We propose the first valid (differential) attack on SPEEDY-7-192 with a time complexity of $$2^{186.36}$$. The search of the differential is achievied by chaining one round characteristics whom we selected based on criterias on their shape. The validity of the characteristics (and thereby of the differential) is verified using the quasidiffeential framework. Finally, we searched for the best probabilistically-extended differential and finalized the attack using the KyRiDi tool."
