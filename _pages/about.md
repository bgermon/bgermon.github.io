# About me
I am a PhD student since October 2024 in the [CAPSULE](https://team.inria.fr/capsule/) team under the supervision
of [Patrick Derbez](https://people.irisa.fr/Patrick.Derbez/) and [Christina Boura](https://christinaboura.wordpress.com/). I'm located in Rennes at the [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/)/[Inria centre.](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-rennes).
I am currently working on differential cryptanalysis and in particular I am 
interested in the validity of differential distinguishers. To this end, I am studying
the quasidifferential framework and its extensions to compute the probability of differential
(characteristics) without relying on any independence hypothesis.
